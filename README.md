# pull-request-auto-reviewer-private

![action example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pshergie/pull-request-auto-reviewer/main/img/example.jpg)

## Usage

Use this action in order to auto post comments in pull requests based on the changes

## Setup

Insert the action into your GitHub workflow. An example:

```yml
name: Auto-review comment
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
jobs:
  prepare:
    name: Auto-review
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2
      - name: Analyze changes
        id: hello
        uses: pshergie/auto-review-comment-private@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          data-path: .github/auto-review-comment.yml
```

In the config you need to specify 2 params:

- `token`: your GitHub token
- `data-path`: a path to a yaml file with a config that contains `prependMsg` and `checks` props. `prependMsg` is a message that prepends to every message of the bot. Keep empty if not needed. **By default** it's `üóØÔ∏è [pull-request-auto-reviewer]:` (as per screenshot). `checks` props consists of pairs of `paths` and `message` keys. `paths` dedicated to specify path(s) of changes that would trigger posting of followed `message` as a pull request comment. In case of multiple `paths` they should be separated by a comma. `message` could be a simple string or markdown. All messages will be combined into a single comment. An example of such a file:
